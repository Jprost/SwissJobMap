# SwissEmploymentMap
After spending some time on LinkedIn, I felt that a map was missing to have
a clear and straight forward visualization of the Swiss employment market.
This repo is the contains the data and the code to build an interactive web app.
The page contains a map and four charts to explore the Helvetic job offering 
during November 2020.

The web app can be found [here](https://swiss-job-map.herokuapp.com/)

Upgrade incoming : integrate automating update and time filtering thanks run on a RaspberryPie
